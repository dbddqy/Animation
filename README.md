Animation plugin for rhino

Developed by Yue and Zongzi, this lightweight plug-in with less than 10 components helps designers to make animations in grasshopper. What it dose is firstly taking in the geometry, material and camera information, then creating the geometries in rhino document, capturing the viewport and finally delete the geometries and materials it created. The animation function of the generic slider component is needed to define the animation frames and run the whole process.

3 example files are provided to help understand the work flow.
